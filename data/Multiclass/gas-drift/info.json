Each measurement represents a 128-dimensional feature vector derived from 8 features extracted per sensor. The task is to classify six different gases (Ethanol, Ethylene, Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, and Toluene) based on sensor responses. The dataset is commonly used for studying drift compensation and long-term stability in gas sensor arrays.\n",
